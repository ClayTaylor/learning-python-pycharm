result = cube(4)
print(result)

# 1) Define the Function and its name (with parameters).
# 2) Code what I want the function to do.
# 3) Define what I want to be returned out of that function by using return.
# 4) Print what was given back to me from the function.
# 5) Once Python has reached the return in the function, anything else below it in the function will not print, effectively
# "breaking me out" of the function and moving on down the code.
# Side Note: Variables can be stored inside the function and can be called on outside of the function with pre-determined values.
