Python Interpreter

A Python Interpreter is an environment where I can execute Python Commands similar to a sand-box environment where I can test out different commands and
functions in a safe and neautral environment without risk to an existing project.

This can be accessed using the terminal or the CMD prompt (depending on which local machine one is coding on) and by typing 'python'.

This is NOT a place to write serious Python code. This is just a quick and easy way to test out simple code.
